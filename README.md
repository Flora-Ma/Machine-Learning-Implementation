# Machine-Learning-Practice
Machine learning algorithms implementation from scratch and example usage.  

**\*.py** is algorithm implementation file, e.g. linear_regression.py.  
And **test_\*.py** are test cases of corresponing algorithms, including test cases of self implementations and commenly used public libraries, e.g. test_linear_regression.py.
