# Machine-Learning-Practice
Machine learning algorithms implementation or usage.  

***.py is algorithm implementation detail file, e.g. linear_regression.py.  
test_***.py are test cases of corresponing algorithms, including test cases of self implementations and commenly used public libraries, e.g. test_linear_regression.py.
